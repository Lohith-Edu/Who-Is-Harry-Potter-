            Harry, a.k.a. the Boy Who Lived, is the most famous wizard in the world (and the wizarding world). He was orphaned as an infant by an attack by Lord Voldemort, which usually killed everyone in one hit. The attack gave him a lightning-bolt shaped scar on his forehead, and Voldemort appeared to be dead, which was good news because Voldemort was a killer who wanted society to consist of people who are pure blood (which meant that both parents were wizards). Sadly, since his parents didn't make it out alive, he was raised by his dreadful nonmagical uncle and aunt. He didn't have a clue about who he and his parents truly were until he turned 11 and the wizarding world reclaimed him. Invited to learn at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, he met his best friends for life, Ron (a sweet doofus) and Hermione (a hypercapable brainiac), and spent the next seven years with them there, getting into mischief and defeating evil. The scar, weirdly, was a kind of portal to Voldemort, so when it starts hurting for the first time in decades, it meant that Voldemort was coming back.
